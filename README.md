### LearningRPG
This is a learning RPG game that alows the player to choose their own skill set based on the attributes chosen. There are eight biomes and eight bosses that are randomly placed throughout the map. 
The attributes menu alows you to choose from a variety of attributes that give the player bonuses in the specified category. The skills menu allows the player to use what skills they would like to start off with. When the player collides with the enemy, they can choose to attack, run, or rejuvenate. 
After they collide they have to also answer the questions based on their chosen attributes.
